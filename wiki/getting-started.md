# Getting Started

Welcome to Solaris! This guide will help you understand the basics and get your energy empire started.

## First Steps

### 1. Starting the Game

When you first launch Solaris, you'll see the main game interface with:
- **Header**: Shows your current energy and energy per second (E/s)
- **Producers Panel**: List of available energy producers
- **Visualization**: A solar system animation showing your progress
- **Upgrades Panel**: Available upgrades to boost production

### 2. Your First Producer

You begin with access to **Solar Panels**. These simple photovoltaic cells generate 0.1 energy per second each.

1. Make sure the Solar Panel is selected (highlighted)
2. Press `Enter` to purchase your first Solar Panel
3. Watch your energy start accumulating!

### 3. Manual Mining

While waiting for energy, you can manually mine:
- Press `Space` to manually generate energy
- Each click gives you 1 energy plus 5% of your current E/s
- Manual mining becomes more powerful with upgrades

## Understanding the UI

### Header Bar
```
Energy: 1,234.56 | +45.67/s | Producers: 15 | Achievements: 12/260
```
- **Energy**: Your current energy balance
- **+X/s**: Current production rate (energy per second)
- **Producers**: Total number of producers owned
- **Achievements**: Unlocked / Total achievements

### Producer List

Each producer shows:
```
▤ Solar Panel (5)        0.50 E/s       Cost: 23.49
```
- **Icon**: Unique symbol for each producer type
- **Name**: Producer name
- **(count)**: How many you own
- **E/s**: Current production from this producer type
- **Cost**: Price for the next purchase

### Buy Amount

Press `Tab` to cycle between purchase amounts:
- **1x**: Buy one at a time
- **10x**: Buy 10 at once
- **Max**: Buy as many as you can afford

## Progression Path

### Early Game (0 - 1,000 E/s)

1. **Solar Panels First**: Buy 5-10 Solar Panels initially
2. **Unlock Mining Drones**: Save up 100 energy for your first Mining Drone
3. **Balance Purchases**: Alternate between Solar Panels and Mining Drones
4. **Watch for Upgrades**: When you own enough producers, upgrades become available

### Upgrade Strategy

Upgrades appear when you meet their requirements:
- **Producer Upgrades**: Own specific counts (1, 5, 25, 50, 100...)
- **Synergy Upgrades**: Own 15+ of two adjacent producer types
- **Global Upgrades**: Reach production rate milestones
- **Manual Upgrades**: Reach click milestones
- **Cosmic Cat Upgrades**: Reach E/s thresholds (very powerful with achievements!)

**Tip**: Always check if an upgrade cost is less than 10 minutes of production. If so, it's usually worth buying!

### Special Mechanics

Two producers have unique mechanics that make them valuable throughout the game:

**Solar Panels (Thousand Rays):**
- First 3 upgrades boost both Solar Panel CPS AND manual mining 2x each
- Later upgrades add bonus energy based on your total non-panel buildings
- Don't neglect Solar Panels - they scale with your entire empire!

**Mining Drones (Drone Network):**
- Gain synergies from ALL other building types
- With 50+ drones and network upgrades: every building gets bonus CPS
- Invest in Mining Drones early for empire-wide bonuses

### Unlocking New Producers

New producers unlock when you buy at least 1 of the previous producer:
- Buy 1 Solar Panel → Mining Drone unlocks
- Buy 1 Mining Drone → Asteroid Mine unlocks
- And so on...

---

## Key Mechanics

### Cost Scaling

Each producer's cost increases by 15% with every purchase:
```
First Solar Panel: 15 energy
Second Solar Panel: 17.25 energy
Third Solar Panel: 19.84 energy
```

Buying in bulk (10x or Max) calculates the total cost automatically.

### Production Multipliers

Your production is affected by multiple bonuses:
1. **Producer Upgrades**: Double (2x) specific producer output each
2. **Global Upgrades**: Boost all production
3. **Synergy Bonuses**: Adjacent producers boost each other (bidirectional!)
4. **Achievements**: +0.5% per achievement unlocked
5. **Cosmic Cats**: Multiply CPS based on your achievement count (very powerful!)

## First Ascension Guide

Once you've earned enough total energy, you can **ascend** to the prestige layer:

### When to Ascend

1. Press `a` to open the Ascension panel
2. Check "Chips on Ascension" - aim for at least 5-10 chips first time
3. The game uses a **cubic formula** - you need ~1 trillion energy for 1 chip
4. **Don't rush!** Achievements persist and power Cosmic Cat upgrades

### What Happens on Ascension

**Reset**:
- Energy balance
- All producers
- All upgrades
- Click count

**Kept**:
- Achievements (and their +0.5% bonus + Stellar Essence for Cosmic Cats!)
- Stellar Chips earned
- Prestige upgrades purchased
- Total ascension count

### First Prestige Upgrades to Buy

1. **Stellar Foundation** (1 chip): +5% all production
2. **Quick Start** (3 chips): Start with 100 energy
3. **Seasoned Explorer** (10 chips): Start with Mining Drone unlocked

---

## Tips for New Players

1. **Don't Rush Ascension**: Build up achievements first - they power Cosmic Cats!
2. **Achievements Matter**: Each achievement gives +0.5% production AND +4% Stellar Essence
3. **Check Upgrades Regularly**: They provide massive boosts (2x each!)
4. **Use Max Buy**: For late-game producers, buying one at a time is inefficient
5. **Offline Progress Works**: Close the game and come back to bonus energy (up to 8 hours)
6. **Boss Mode**: Press `` ` `` (backtick) to disguise as a spreadsheet
7. **Don't Neglect Solar Panels**: Thousand Rays makes them scale with all buildings
8. **Invest in Mining Drones**: Drone Network boosts your entire empire
