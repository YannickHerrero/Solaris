## Synergy Upgrades (19 total)

Synergy upgrades create production chains where one producer type boosts another.

### Effect
Each synergy upgrade grants **+2% bonus per source producer** to the target producer (capped at 2.5x maximum).

### Formula
```
Target Multiplier = min(2.5, 1.0 + (0.02 × source_count))
```

Example: With 100 Mining Drones and the Drone-Mine Synergy:
- Asteroid Mine bonus = min(2.5, 1.0 + (0.02 × 100)) = 2.5x multiplier (capped)

```
1.05 × 1.10 × 1.15 × 1.25 × 1.35 × 1.50 × 1.75 × 2.00 × 2.50 × 3.00 = 68.67x
```

## Manual/Click Upgrades (10 total)

Manual upgrades double your manual mining (Space bar) power. They unlock based on total clicks.

| ID | Name | Required Clicks | Cost | Effect |
|----|------|-----------------|------|--------|
| 9101 | Reinforced Pickaxe | 50 | 500 | 2x manual mining |
| 9102 | Power Gauntlets | 200 | 5,000 | 2x manual mining |
| 9103 | Neural Interface | 1,000 | 50,000 | 2x manual mining |
| 9104 | Quantum Harvester | 5,000 | 500,000 | 2x manual mining |
| 9105 | Cosmic Grip | 20,000 | 5,000,000 | 2x manual mining |
| 9106 | Reality Punch | 100,000 | 50,000,000 | 2x manual mining |
| 9107 | Dimensional Strike | 500,000 | 500,000,000 | 2x manual mining |
| 9108 | Universal Touch | 2,000,000 | 5,000,000,000 | 2x manual mining |
| 9109 | Omnipotent Hand | 10,000,000 | 50,000,000,000 | 2x manual mining |
| 9110 | Infinite Power | 50,000,000 | 500,000,000,000 | 2x manual mining |

### Cumulative Manual Multiplier

With all manual upgrades:
```
2^10 = 1,024x manual mining power
```

### Manual Mining Formula

Energy from manual mining:
```
Energy = (click_power × manual_multiplier) + (0.05 × total_eps)
```

Where:
- `click_power` = 1 (base)
- `manual_multiplier` = cumulative 2x from upgrades
- `total_eps` = your total energy per second

This means manual mining scales with your production!
