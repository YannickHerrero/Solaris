# Solaris Wiki

Welcome to the official wiki for **Solaris**, a terminal-based idle game where you harness the power of the cosmos to generate infinite energy.

## Game Overview

Solaris is an incremental/idle game inspired by classic incremental games. Starting with simple Solar Panels, you'll progress through 20 increasingly powerful energy producers, from Mining Drones to Big Bang Catalysts that create pocket universes.
