# Strategy Guide

This guide covers optimization tips and strategies for efficient progression in Solaris.

## General Principles

### The Payback Rule

Before buying anything, consider the **payback time**:

```
payback_time = cost / production_gain
```

**Guidelines:**
- Payback under 5 minutes: **Always buy**
- Payback 5-15 minutes: **Usually worth it**
- Payback 15-60 minutes: **Consider alternatives**
- Payback over 60 minutes: **Wait or buy cheaper options**

### Upgrades vs Producers

Upgrades are almost always better than producers when available:
- Producer upgrades **double** output (2x)
- A new producer adds linear output
- Prioritize upgrades when their cost is reasonable

### The 15% Rule

Producer costs increase by 15% each. This means:
- Buying 10 producers costs about 20x the first one
- Diversifying across multiple producer types is often efficient
- Don't over-invest in a single producer

## Early Game Strategy (0 - 10K E/s)

### First 5 Minutes

1. **Buy 5 Solar Panels** - Establishes baseline income
2. **Manual mine** while waiting - Each click gives 1 energy + 5% of E/s
3. **Unlock Mining Drone** - Save 100 energy for your first Mining Drone
4. **Balance purchases** - Alternate between Solar Panels and Mining Drones

### First Upgrades

Watch for these upgrades to appear:
- **Better Silicon** (100 energy, 1 Solar Panel): Priority buy
- **Improved Thrusters** (500 energy, 1 Mining Drone): Priority buy

**Rule**: If an upgrade costs less than 10 minutes of production, buy it immediately.

### Reaching 1,000 E/s

Typical path:
1. 25+ Solar Panels (for Quantum Dots upgrade)
2. 15+ Mining Drones (for synergy unlock preparation)
3. 5+ Asteroid Mines
4. Your first Orbital Station

---

## Mid Game Strategy (10K - 1M E/s)

### Producer Priorities

1. **Focus on 2-3 producer types** at a time
2. **Hit upgrade thresholds**: 25, 50, 100
3. **Unlock synergies** when you have 15+ of adjacent producers

### Synergy Focus

Synergies provide excellent value:
- +5% per source producer to target
- With 50 source producers: 3.5x multiplier
- Prioritize synergies for your highest-tier producers

### Global Upgrades

Buy global upgrades as soon as you meet the E/s requirement:
- **Efficient Wiring** (10 E/s, 1K cost): +5%
- **Central Grid** (100 E/s, 10K cost): +10%
- **Dark Energy Tap** (1K E/s, 100K cost): +15%

These affect **all** production multiplicatively.

### First Ascension Preparation

Before your first ascension:
1. Reach at least **1 trillion total energy earned**
2. Unlock as many achievements as possible (they persist!)
3. Aim for 5-10 Stellar Chips minimum

---

## Late Game Strategy (1M - 1B E/s)

### Upgrade Threshold Focus

At this stage, hitting upgrade thresholds is crucial:
- **100 producers**: Unlocks tier 5 upgrade (32x total)
- **150 producers**: Unlocks tier 6 upgrade (64x total)
- **200 producers**: Unlocks tier 7 upgrade (128x total)

### Synergy Chains

Build up your synergy chains:
1. **Source producers** boost targets significantly
2. Keep source producers high even if they're "weak"
3. Solar Panel → Big Bang Catalyst synergy completes the circle!

### Achievement Hunting

Focus on achievements for the +1% bonus each:
- **Producer achievements**: Get each producer to 100
- **Time achievements**: Leave game running
- **Click achievements**: Manual mine when idle

---

## Prestige Strategy

### When to Ascend

**First Ascension:**
- Aim for 5-10 chips
- This usually requires ~100T total energy
- Don't rush - achievements persist!

**Subsequent Ascensions:**
- Ascend when you'd earn 50%+ more chips than current total
- Or when progress has significantly slowed

### Recommended Upgrade Order

**Priority 1 (Immediate Impact):**
1. Stellar Foundation (1 chip) - Instant +5%
2. Quick Start (3 chips) - Faster restarts
3. Stellar Efficiency (30 chips) - +25%

**Priority 2 (Progression Speed):**
4. Seasoned Explorer (10 chips) - Skip Solar grind
5. Accelerated Start (20 chips) - Start with 3 producers
6. Universal Knowledge (50 chips) - Start with 5 producers

**Priority 3 (Multiplicative Growth):**
7. Cosmic Mastery (150 chips) - +100%
8. Rapid Expansion (300 chips) - Start with 7 producers
9. Infinite Power (1500 chips) - +500%

**Priority 4 (Long-term Value):**
10. Cosmic Legacy (15 chips) - +1% per ascension
11. Dimensional Echo (75 chips) - +1% per achievement

### Chip Efficiency

Calculate your **chips per hour** rate:
```
chips_per_hour = potential_chips / time_to_earn
```

Ascend when this rate starts declining significantly.

## End Game Strategy (1B+ E/s)

### High-Tier Producers

For producers 16-20:
- Very expensive but very powerful
- Each gives 5x the production of previous
- Worth pursuing once you have strong multipliers

### Stacking Multipliers

Your total multiplier comes from:
1. Producer upgrades: Up to 32,768x each
2. Global upgrades: Up to 68.67x combined
3. Achievements: Up to 13.2x at 260
4. Prestige: Up to 173.25x base
5. Per-ascension bonuses: Scales with ascensions
6. Synergies: Scales with producer counts

**Combined potential: Astronomical multipliers!**

### Achievement Completion

Target these achievement categories:
1. **Producer milestones**: Get all 20 producers to 300
2. **Energy milestones**: Reach 1Q E/s (Infinite Power)
3. **Lifetime energy**: Earn 1 sextillion total
4. **Ascension milestones**: Ascend 500 times

## Optimization Tips

### 1. Use Max Buy Mode

For late-game producers:
- Press `Tab` until you see "Max"
- One click buys as many as affordable
- Much faster than clicking repeatedly

### 2. Check Upgrades Frequently

Press `u` regularly to see new upgrades:
- Upgrades unlock based on producer count
- Easy to miss them while focusing on other things

### 3. Overnight Progress

Take advantage of offline progress:
- Game earns energy for up to 8 hours offline
- Prestige upgrades boost offline earnings to 1.65x
- Leave game overnight for significant progress

### 4. Balance Producer Counts

Don't neglect lower-tier producers:
- They contribute to synergy chains
- Their upgrades are cheaper
- Achievement milestones apply to all producers

### 5. Achievement Priority

Some achievements are easier than others:
- **Time achievements**: Passive, just leave running
- **Producer Novice/Initiate**: Buy 1-10 of each type
- **Click milestones**: Manual mine during idle moments

---

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Ascending Too Early

- You lose all progress except achievements and prestige
- Make sure you've earned significant achievements first
- Aim for meaningful chip gains (at least 5-10 first time)

### 2. Ignoring Upgrades

- Upgrades provide 2x multipliers
- Always check available upgrades
- A single upgrade can double your entire production

### 3. Over-focusing One Producer

- Diversification is generally better
- Each producer has upgrade thresholds worth hitting
- Synergies reward balanced builds

### 4. Neglecting Synergies

- Synergies provide massive bonuses
- +5% per source producer adds up quickly
- With 100 source producers: 6x multiplier!

### 5. Forgetting Manual Mining

- Manual mining scales with E/s (5% bonus)
- Click upgrades make it very powerful
- Good for active play sessions

## Quick Reference

### Production Milestones

| Milestone | Typical Progress |
|-----------|------------------|
| 100 E/s | Have 3-4 producer types |
| 1,000 E/s | First global upgrades |
| 10,000 E/s | Mid-game producers unlocked |
| 100,000 E/s | Ready for first ascension consideration |
| 1M E/s | Post-first-ascension goal |
| 1B E/s | Late-game producers active |
| 1T E/s | End-game multiplier stacking |

### Upgrade Priority

1. **Producer upgrades** < 5 min payback
2. **Global upgrades** when E/s requirement met
3. **Synergy upgrades** when both producers at 15+
4. **Manual upgrades** when click count met

### Prestige Priority

1. Production multipliers (compounding effect)
2. Producer unlock shortcuts (faster restarts)
3. Chip bonus upgrades (long-term value)
4. Quality of life (offline, energy retention)
