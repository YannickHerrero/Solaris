# Strategy Guide

This guide covers optimization tips and strategies for efficient progression in Solaris.

## General Principles

### The Payback Rule

Before buying anything, consider the **payback time**:

```
payback_time = cost / production_gain
```

**Guidelines:**
- Payback under 5 minutes: **Always buy**
- Payback 5-15 minutes: **Usually worth it**
- Payback 15-60 minutes: **Consider alternatives**
- Payback over 60 minutes: **Wait or buy cheaper options**

### Upgrades vs Producers

Upgrades are almost always better than producers when available:
- Producer upgrades give **2x multiplier** each (Cookie Clicker style)
- A new producer adds linear output
- Prioritize upgrades when their cost is reasonable

### The 15% Rule

All producer costs increase by 15% each (flat across all tiers). This means:
- Buying 10 producers costs about 20x the first one
- Diversifying across multiple producer types is often efficient
- Don't over-invest in a single producer

## New Mechanics Strategy

### Thousand Rays (Solar Panels)

Solar Panels have unique upgrades that scale with your total buildings:

**Early Game (Tiers 1-3):**
- Buy these ASAP - they boost both Solar Panel CPS AND manual mining 2x each
- With all 3: 8x manual mining and 8x Solar Panel base CPS

**Mid Game (Tier 4 - Thousand Rays):**
- Becomes valuable once you have ~100+ non-panel buildings
- Adds +0.1 energy per building to both panels and clicks

**Late Game (Tiers 5-15):**
- Multiplies the Thousand Rays bonus dramatically
- With all upgrades: Your Solar Panels and clicks scale with your entire empire!

**Key Insight**: Don't neglect Solar Panels in late game. The Thousand Rays mechanic makes them scale infinitely with your building count.

### Drone Network (Mining Drones)

Mining Drones synergize with ALL other building types:

**Network Upgrades:**
- Buy when you have 15+ of any building type
- Each network gives 2x to Mining Drones AND +1% per 50 drones

**Workforce Upgrades:**
- Buy when you have 50+ drones and 15+ of the building
- The target building gains +1% CPS per 50 drones

**Strategy:**
1. Rush to 50+ Mining Drones early
2. Buy network upgrades as buildings unlock
3. With 200 drones and all networks: Every building gets +4% CPS bonus!

### Stellar Essence & Cosmic Cats

This is Cookie Clicker's "milk and kittens" system:

**Stellar Essence:**
- You gain 4% Stellar Essence per achievement
- At 260 achievements: 10.4 Stellar Essence (1040%)

**Cosmic Cats:**
- Each cat multiplies CPS by (1 + essence × 0.05)
- With 260 achievements: each cat = 1.52x multiplier
- With all 15 cats: 1.52^15 = **695x** multiplier!

**Strategy:**
- Achievements are CRITICAL - they power your Cosmic Cats
- Buy Cosmic Cat upgrades as soon as affordable
- Don't rush ascension - unlock achievements first!

### Bidirectional Synergies

There are now 38 synergies (forward AND reverse):

**Strategy:**
- Both adjacent buildings benefit each other
- With 75+ of any building: both neighbors get 2.5x bonus
- Diversification is more valuable than ever!

---

## Early Game Strategy (0 - 10K E/s)

### First 5 Minutes

1. **Buy 5 Solar Panels** - Establishes baseline income
2. **Manual mine** while waiting - Each click gives 1 energy + 5% of E/s
3. **Unlock Mining Drone** - Save 100 energy for your first Mining Drone
4. **Balance purchases** - Alternate between Solar Panels and Mining Drones

### First Upgrades

Watch for these upgrades to appear:
- **Enhanced Photovoltaics** (100 energy, 1 Solar Panel): 2x panels AND clicks!
- **Reinforced Drill Bits** (1K energy, 1 Mining Drone): 2x drones

**Rule**: If an upgrade costs less than 10 minutes of production, buy it immediately.

### Reaching 1,000 E/s

Typical path:
1. 25+ Solar Panels (for Solar Amplification upgrade)
2. 15+ Mining Drones (for first Drone Network)
3. 10+ Asteroid Mines
4. Your first Orbital Stations

---

## Mid Game Strategy (10K - 1M E/s)

### Producer Priorities

1. **Focus on 2-3 producer types** at a time
2. **Hit upgrade thresholds**: 1, 5, 25, 50, 100
3. **Unlock synergies** when you have 15+ of adjacent producers
4. **Build up Mining Drones** to 50+ for Workforce upgrades

### Synergy Focus

Synergies provide excellent value:
- +2% per source producer to target (capped at 2.5x)
- With 75+ source producers: 2.5x multiplier (cap reached)
- Both directions now! Building A boosts B AND B boosts A

### Global Upgrades

Buy global upgrades as soon as you meet the E/s requirement:
- **Efficient Wiring** (10 E/s, 1K cost): +5%
- **Central Grid** (100 E/s, 10K cost): +10%
- **Dark Energy Tap** (1K E/s, 100K cost): +15%

These affect **all** production multiplicatively.

### First Ascension Preparation

Before your first ascension:
1. Reach at least **1 trillion total energy earned** (cubic formula!)
2. Unlock as many achievements as possible (they persist and power Cosmic Cats!)
3. Aim for 5-10 Stellar Chips minimum

---

## Late Game Strategy (1M - 1B E/s)

### Upgrade Threshold Focus

At this stage, hitting upgrade thresholds is crucial:
- **100 producers**: Unlocks tier 5 upgrade (32x total)
- **150 producers**: Unlocks tier 6 upgrade (64x total)
- **200 producers**: Unlocks tier 7 upgrade (128x total)

### Synergy Chains

Build up your synergy chains:
1. **Both directions matter** - invest in both neighbors
2. Keep source producers high even if they're "weak"
3. Solar Panel → Big Bang Catalyst AND Catalyst → Solar Panel!

### Achievement Hunting

Focus on achievements for multiple bonuses:
- **+0.5% production bonus** each (base)
- **+4% Stellar Essence** each (for Cosmic Cats!)
- **Producer achievements**: Get each producer to 100
- **Time achievements**: Leave game running
- **Click achievements**: Manual mine when idle

### Cosmic Cat Priority

Buy Cosmic Cat upgrades as they become affordable:
- **Cosmic Kittens** (9M cost): First cat upgrade
- Each subsequent cat multiplies CPS by ~1.5x (with full achievements)

---

## Prestige Strategy

### When to Ascend (Cubic Formula)

The cubic formula means slower chip gains:
- First Ascension: Aim for 5-10 chips (requires ~125T-1Q energy)
- You need **8x the energy** for just **2x the chips**!
- Don't rush - achievements persist and are VERY valuable

**Subsequent Ascensions:**
- Ascend when you'd earn 50%+ more chips than current total
- Or when progress has significantly slowed
- Remember: achievements carry over, so unlock them first!

### Recommended Upgrade Order

**Priority 1 (Immediate Impact):**
1. Stellar Foundation (1 chip) - Instant +5%
2. Quick Start (3 chips) - Faster restarts
3. Stellar Efficiency (30 chips) - +15%

**Priority 2 (Progression Speed):**
4. Seasoned Explorer (10 chips) - Skip Solar grind
5. Accelerated Start (20 chips) - Start with 3 producers
6. Universal Knowledge (50 chips) - Start with 5 producers

**Priority 3 (Multiplicative Growth):**
7. Cosmic Mastery (150 chips) - +50%
8. Rapid Expansion (300 chips) - Start with 7 producers
9. Infinite Power (1500 chips) - +100%

**Priority 4 (Long-term Value):**
10. Dimensional Echo (75 chips) - +0.25% per achievement (scales with Cats!)
11. Chip bonus upgrades - More chips per run

### Chip Efficiency

Calculate your **chips per hour** rate:
```
chips_per_hour = potential_chips / time_to_earn
```

Ascend when this rate starts declining significantly.

---

## End Game Strategy (1B+ E/s)

### High-Tier Producers

For producers 16-20:
- Very expensive but very powerful
- Each gives ~5-8x the production of previous
- Worth pursuing once you have strong multipliers

### Stacking Multipliers

Your total multiplier comes from:
1. Producer upgrades: Up to **32,768x** each (2^15)
2. Global upgrades: Up to **68.67x** combined
3. Achievements: Up to **3.67x** at 260
4. Cosmic Cats: Up to **~700x** with full achievements
5. Prestige: Astronomical multipliers possible
6. Per-ascension bonuses: Up to **~91%** per ascension
7. Synergies: Up to **2.5x** per producer (capped, bidirectional)

### Achievement Completion

Target these achievement categories:
1. **Producer milestones**: Get all 20 producers to 300+
2. **Energy milestones**: Reach highest E/s tiers
3. **Lifetime energy**: Earn maximum total
4. **Ascension milestones**: Ascend 500+ times

---

## Optimization Tips

### 1. Use Max Buy Mode

For late-game producers:
- Press `Tab` until you see "Max"
- One click buys as many as affordable
- Much faster than clicking repeatedly

### 2. Check Upgrades Frequently

Press `u` regularly to see new upgrades:
- Upgrades unlock based on producer count
- Easy to miss them while focusing on other things
- New categories: Click CPS, Per-Building, Cosmic Cats!

### 3. Overnight Progress

Take advantage of offline progress:
- Game earns energy for up to 8 hours offline
- Prestige upgrades boost offline earnings up to **~26x**
- Leave game overnight for significant progress

### 4. Balance Producer Counts

Don't neglect lower-tier producers:
- They contribute to synergy chains (both directions!)
- Their upgrades are cheaper
- Achievement milestones apply to all producers
- Solar Panels scale with ALL buildings (Thousand Rays!)
- Mining Drones boost ALL buildings (Drone Network!)

### 5. Achievement Priority

Some achievements are easier than others:
- **Time achievements**: Passive, just leave running
- **Producer Novice/Initiate**: Buy 1-10 of each type
- **Click milestones**: Manual mine during idle moments
- **Remember**: Each achievement = +4% Stellar Essence for Cosmic Cats!

---

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Ascending Too Early

- You lose all progress except achievements and prestige
- Make sure you've earned significant achievements first
- Aim for meaningful chip gains (at least 5-10 first time)
- Achievements power Cosmic Cats - don't skip them!

### 2. Ignoring Upgrades

- Upgrades provide **2x multipliers** each
- Always check available upgrades
- A single upgrade can double your entire production
- New upgrade categories add massive bonuses!

### 3. Over-focusing One Producer

- Diversification is generally better
- Each producer has upgrade thresholds worth hitting
- Synergies reward balanced builds (both directions!)
- Solar Panels and Mining Drones scale with everything

### 4. Neglecting Synergies

- Synergies provide valuable bonuses
- +2% per source producer (capped at 2.5x)
- Now bidirectional - both neighbors benefit!
- With 75+ source producers: 2.5x multiplier (cap)

### 5. Forgetting Manual Mining

- Manual mining scales with E/s (5% + Click CPS upgrades)
- Click upgrades make it very powerful
- Thousand Rays adds building-based bonus to clicks
- Good for active play sessions

### 6. Ignoring Cosmic Cats

- Cosmic Cats are one of the most powerful multipliers
- They scale with achievements (4% Stellar Essence each)
- Buy them as soon as affordable
- With full achievements: **~700x multiplier**!
